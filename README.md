I am an **hybrid** Software engineer 🧑‍💻 / proud **Father** of two sons & Happy **Husband** 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 / International Conference Organizer !


Previously a skilled **Java backend developer**, I slowly moved to a Solution architect, and **DevOps** Evangelist.
Since year, I am working more in automating and development, quality check and deployment process.
My main tools are **Jenkins**, **Gitlab**, **Nexus**, **SonarQube*, **Docker**, and now **Kubernetes**.

I am still interested by development, but even if my favorite field stays Java, I am also looking to Golang and I plan to look at Rust also.
And of course, some shell scripts :-)

Aside of that, I am organazing with some friends the [VoxxedDays Luxembourg conference](https://luxembourg.voxxeddays.com/en/), an international Developer Conference in Luxembourg.

And finally, when I found time, I like to do photography 📷, especially macro of buglife 🐛 🕷️ 🦋
